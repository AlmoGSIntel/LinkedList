# LinkedList
Python Library which implements the LinkedList class from Java, or other programming language.                                                 

To use it just create an object of the class like so:                                                                                     
link_list_object = LinkedList()                                                                                                         
From here use it just like a regular list.                                                                                                 

You can also use it like so:                                                                                                               
link_list_object = LinkedList(item1, item2, item3, item4,....)                                                                             

or like so:                                                                                                                               
link_list_object = LinkedList(i for i in iterator)                                                                                         

I wish you to enjoy my Library.
Have a greate programming day.
